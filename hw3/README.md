* Programming Language: **Python 2.7**
* Required Library:
  1. `python numpy` -- for scientific computing
  2. `python networkx` -- for Q.14 to automatic generate the tree graph
  3. `graphviz` -- for visualing the tree of Q.14

*Programs should be work with training file name as parameters_
_e.g. `python2.7 q7_q13.py <training file> <testing_file>`*

* List of contents:
  * `hw3_model.py` -- implementation of AdaBoost, Decision Stump, and Decision Tree
  * `q7_q13.py` -- run experiments with AdaBoost
  * `q14_q16.py` -- run experiments with Decision Tree
  * `hw2.sh` -- execute all the questions at a time
